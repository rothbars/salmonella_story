                <br>
                <p><i>Salmonella</i> is a bacteria which causes salmonellosis. This is a relatively
                common foodborne illness characterized by diarrhea, fever, and acute abdominal pain.
                While most cases of salmonellosis last about 4-7 days without treatment or hospital admission, some
                cases can be very severe where the infection spreads to other body sites outside the gut. These
                severe cases are relatively rare but are potentially fatal if not treated properly.
                According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <i>Salmonella</i>
                 infections are responsible for the highest number of hospitalizations and deaths
                of any foodborne illness in the US. </p>

                <br>
                <p><i>Salmonella</i> is found in the guts of many different wild and domesticated
                animals and typically spreads to humans via the fecal-oral route. Most infections
                are believed to result from the consumption of contaminated food or water, but some
                infections can come from certain environmental exposures like handling reptiles.</p>
                <p>In the latest summary report published by the Oregon Health Authority in 2016,
                  Oregon experienced 448 reported cases of salmonellosis. Of these 448 reported
                  cases, 46 were associated with outbreaks. </p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Oregon's Unique History with <i>Salmonella</i></h2>
                <br>
              <p>In September 1984, an outbreak of <i>Salmonella</i> occurred within
              the community of The Dalles in Eastern Oregon. The Dalles had relatively
              few cases of <i>Salmonella</i> in the past and had a population of 10,500.
              A team of epidemiologists from the local, state, and CDC eventually found 751
              people in The Dalles whose disease matched the outbreak strain of <i>Salmonella</i>.
              Of the 751 people who became ill, 45 required hospitalization and none died.
              It eventually came to light that a religious group which had settled in the area a few
              years prior deliberately contaminated several local salad bars in The Dalles in the hopes
              of swaying local elections. The 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack was, and still is,
              considered the largest domestic bioterrorist attack in US history.  </p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Current Trends in Oregon</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Cases of <i>Salmonella</i> in Oregon are fairly constant across time since 2002 according
                to the Oregon Health Authority report in 2016. Oregon consistently has fewer cases per
               capita than the US as a whole. Generally, incidence of salmonellosis is slightly higher among females
               compared to males though the reasons behind this are speculative. The elderly, the
               immunocompromised, and especially young children aged 0-4 are at highest risk for <i>Salmonella</i>
               infection. </p>

                <br><br>
                <p>The <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria can be classified into distinct serotypes. A serotype
                is a group within a bacteria species which share similar surface/chemical features and
                are used in outbreak investigations. Though, the overall incidence rate of <i>Salmonella</i>
                cases within Oregon is fairly constant over time, the incidence of certain serotypes are
                increasing in Oregon. These include the Enteritidis and Typhimirium serotypes.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Expectations for the Future</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Trends in <i>Salmonella</i> incidence are largely seasonal right now, with higher
                incidences reported in the summer months when temperatures are hotter compared to the
                winter. There is some concern that increasing global temperatures will also lead to an
                increase in the incidence of salmonellosis. In Oregon, the state health department
                (the Oregon Health Authority) partners with county level health departments to monitor
                trends of disease and intervene in outbreak scenarios. There is currently a statewide
                electronic database of reported <i>Salmonella</i> cases. The use of electronic health
                information will certainly make identifying outbreaks and cases easier in the future.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>In most cases businesses associated with a <i>Salmonella</i> outbreak voluntarily close
                  during the investigation. An increase in education efforts for restaurants and individuals
                  linked to outbreaks are being used to prevent future outbreaks. As detection techniques
                 become more sophisticated it is expected that more cases of <i>Salmonella</i> will
                be reported to the Oregon Health Authority. However, given that this disease is severely
                underreported it would be worth careful evaluation to determine if an increase in reported cases
                is due to an increase in disease or more accurate reporting. </p>

# Oregon *Salmonella* Story Map
This storymap was designed to provide a brief background into what the *Salmonella*
bacteria is and its unique effect and history in the state of Oregon. Much of the
information presented here can be found written in yearly reports by the Oregon
Health Authority but my hope is that by showing this information in a more interactive
context that it will be more easily understood by health officials and policy
makers within Oregon.

The website can be accessed [here](https://rothbars.github.io/salmonellastory/)

## Storyline of the Map
1. The story will begin by providing background details, definitions, and other
necessary information to understand the *Salmonella* bacteria are and what it
causes. Next, I will move into the unique history Oregon has involving the bacteria.
Oregon was home to the largest domestic bioterrorist attack in US history in 1984.
This attack has shaped the public health response to acute outbreaks not only within
Oregon, but nationwide. I hope this background and history section will naturally
lead to the current state of *Salmonella* surveillance in the state.
2. Next, I will examine the current trends of *Salmonella* incidence within Oregon.
I will address trends of specific serotypes of *Salmonella* (groups of *Salmonella*
with similar surface features) and the response from Oregon public health officials.
Specific high-risk groups will be identified and infection rates in Oregon will also
be compared to the US average infection rate. **Important Note** I hope to expand
this section in the future with a more detailed statistical analysis of the spatial
distribution of *Salmonella* infections within Oregon. I hope to bring in choropleth
maps and possibly Kmeans maps to show areas of high similarity.
3. Finally, I will highlight expectations for the future such as elaborate on how disease
trends may change due to environmental influences. I will explain current response
and intervention efforts and how these may change in the future. In this section
I also will introduce an important stakeholder in this research (the Oregon Health
Authority). Much of the information presented here is based on their surveillance
efforts and the more in-depth statistical analysis I hope to bring into the story
map is based on data collected by this agency.
